# Introduction to Multithreading in Java



In Java, we can create new threads in two ways:

1.  Create classes that extend `Thread`;
2.  Create classes that implement the `Runnable` interface.

This repository contains examples that illustrate these two approaches to create threads that do very simple things: compute Fibonacci(n) and compute Factorial(n).
